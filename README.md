# CNNs
## Summary
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images and determine whether a patient has pneumonia. Using a labeled dataset of X-ray scans from patients with and without pneumonia, the goal is to train a deep learning model that can assist in automatic and accurate medical image diagnosis.
