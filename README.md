# Project 2 - CNNs

Please refer to this file and the template if you have any questions! 

## Project Description

In this project, you will be given an X-ray dataset of pneunomia patients. The goal is that you will classify whether or not a patient has penunomia or not based on their X-ray image. To accomplish this, you will build a CNN to identify these images. 

## The dataset (already imported in template)

The dataset can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. But you **do not** have to download it locally before starting the project. The dataset path is already imported in the template that is given to you. The link above is in case you run into any problems with finding it. 

## Submission Criteria 

As you have done for the first project, please submit the project via GitHub. However, this time instead of filling out a google form, please instead submit to the assignment on google classroom with your GitHub username and commit ID. As far as grading criteria goes, we will look primarily for how accurate your model is, you should aim around 65% at least. As always, we will look at your code to see how you initialized the layer to make sure it is standard. 

**This project will be due February 26th!** 

## Tips and last remarks 

- Please use the template, it has a lot of helpful resources for you!
- GET STARTED EARLY. This is meant to be a tough project, so take the time to start early and get all the help you need.
- And have fun while learning along the way :). CNNs and Neural Networks in general are powerful ML techniques to know, so make the most out of this projec!
